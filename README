the new version of this tool is on github

https://github.com/briner/tsm2deb

This new version allow as mainly 2 big differences :
 - it is able to do a one single big package
 - it is has now option so that you can built only a part of tsm (eg:crypto)
 - the integration part used at unige, is a tool that let's user to easily
   configure their tsm, by providing the nodename and a password. This tools
   use a file servers.txt that is a list of:tcspserveraddress port such as
```
servertsm1.example.com 1001
servertsm2.example.com 1002
servertsm3.example.com 1003
servertsm4.example.com 1004
```

for ubuntu trusty 14.4 (14.04) prefer the branch 7.1
https://github.com/briner/tsm2deb/tree/7.1.0.1

This script mainly rewraps the rpm file so that you can use it on ubuntu. Furthermore,
it adds:
 - tsm init script
 - create entry in the menu for dsmj and dsmc
 - dpkg-reconfigure of the "<ORG_NAME>-<TSM_NAME>-ba" package enable automatically
   tsm as daemon if dsm.sys and the tsm server are configured for schedule.
 - dsmc and dsmj works also as a normal user

prerequisite:
- apt-get install fakeroot cpio rpm2cpio bash rsync imagemagick

>>>>>>> e10c22a17d9b57b4ea477a7f921654116dce7866

usage: 
 - download the version 6.3.1.0-TIV-TSMBAC-LinuxX86.tar (try downloading from http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=663&uid=swg21239415)
 - untar eg: into ~/tsm/6.3.1.0
 - download the script tsm4ubuntu and save it to ~/tsm/6.3.1.0
 - edit /etc/tsm/dsm.opt and /etc/tsm/dsm.sys
 - edit the variable defined in define_var in tsm4ubuntu
 - then type
   cd ~/tsm/6.3.1.0
   chmod +x tsm4ubuntu
   ./tsm4ubuntu
   sudo dpkg -i *deb
 - and smile big time

The script is splitted in:
- define variable: self explanatory
- rpm2dir: extract some of the rpms to cpio_<directories>
- wrap_crypt: create the crypt package
- wrap_ssl: create the ssl package
- wrap_ba: create the Backup Agent package
- wrap_api: create the API package
- wrap_integration: this part is only needed for the University of Geneva,
  as we have developped code to automate the creation and the management of
  tsm account. So you don't need to care about this part

So why did we not wrap the other RPMs ?
Our decision is based on this document
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r3/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itsm.client.doc%2Ft_inst_linuxx86client.html
 - *filepath* since it brings only filepath.ko for a special kernel
 - *JBB* since it is the daemon based on the filepath.ko
 - *cit* since this looks like a real burden
 - FR since we speak english
