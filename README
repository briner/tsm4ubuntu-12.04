-------

This script mainly rewraps the rpm file so that you can use it on ubuntu. Furthermore,
it adds:
 - tsm init script
 - create entry in the menu for dsmj and dsmc
 - dpkg-reconfigure of the "<ORG_NAME>-<TSM_NAME>-ba" package enable automatically
   tsm as daemon if dsm.sys and the tsm server are configured for schedule.
 - dsmc and dsmj works also as a normal user

prerequesite:
- apt-get install fakeroot cpio rpm2cpio bash rsync imagemagick

usage: 
 - download the version 6.3.1.0-TIV-TSMBAC-LinuxX86.tar (try downloading from http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=663&uid=swg21239415)
 - untar eg: into ~/tsm/6.3.1.0
 - download the script tsm4ubuntu and save it to ~/tsm/6.3.1.0
 - edit /etc/tsm/dsm.opt and /etc/tsm/dsm.sys
 - edit the variable defined in define_var in tsm4ubuntu
 - then type
   cd ~/tsm/6.3.1.0
   chmod +x tsm4ubuntu
   ./tsm4ubuntu
   sudo dpkg -i *deb
 - and smile big time

The script is splitted in:
- define variable: self explanatory
- rpm2dir: extract some of the rpms to cpio_<directories>
- wrap_crypt: create the crypt package
- wrap_ssl: create the ssl package
- wrap_ba: create the Backup Agent package
- wrap_api: create the API package
- wrap_integration: this part is only needed for the University of Geneva,
  as we have developped code to automate the creation and the management of
  tsm account. So you don't need to care about this part

So why did we not wrap the other RPMs ?
Our decision is based on this document
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r3/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itsm.client.doc%2Ft_inst_linuxx86client.html
 - *filepath* since it brings only filepath.ko for a special kernel
 - *JBB* since it is the daemon based on the filepath.ko
 - *cit* since this looks like a real burden
 - FR since we speak english

Hope it will help.
