This script rewrap the main rpm file so that you can use tsm on ubuntu.
As this packages are not part of ubuntu or debian, I've put all the files under
/opt/uau. If you want to use an other path, change accordingly OPT_PATH and
rewrite the script where we define the soft link.

prerequesite:
- apt-get install fakeroot cpio rpm2cpio bash rsync wget

usage: download the version 6.3.0.0-TIV-TSMBAC-LinuxX86.tar
untar eg: into ~/ubuntu/tsm/6.3.0.0
put the script into ~/ubuntu/tsm/6.3.0.0
download this script, and save it to ~/ubuntu/tsm/6.3.0.0
cd ~/ubuntu/tsm/6.3.0.0
chmod +x tsm4ubuntu
./tsm4ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i *deb


The script is splitted in:
- define variable : self explanatory
- rpm2dir: extract some of the rpms to cpio_<directories>
- wrap_integration: this part is only needed for the University of Geneva,
  as we have developped code to automate the creation and the management of
  tsm account. So you don't need to care about this part
- wrap_ba: create the Backup Agent package
- wrap_api: create the API package
- wrap_crypt: create the crypt package
- wrap_ssl: create the ssl package

what are each rpm for, and which rpm should I rewrap ?
Our decision will be based on this document
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r3/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itsm.client.doc%2Ft_inst_linuxx86client.html
 - *filepath* since it brings only filepath.ko for a special kernel
 - *JBB* since it is the daemon based on the filepath.ko
 - *cit* since this looks like a real burden
 - FR since we speak english
